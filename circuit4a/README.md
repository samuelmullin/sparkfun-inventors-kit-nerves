# Circuit 4A - LCD Screen

## Overview

In [Circuit 4A](./base), you'll print text on an LCD Screen

## Challenges

There are no challenge implementations for this circuit as they don't diverge from the base logic enough to warrant including.

## Hardware

In order to complete these circuits, you'll need the following:

- 1 x Breadboard
- 8 x M-F Jumper cables
- 8 x M-M Jumper cables
- 1 x Analog Potentiometer
- 1 x HD44780 Based 16x2 LCD Screen


## New Concepts

### LCD Screen

An LCD screen consists of an array of pixels arranged in rows and columns.  By turning certain pixels on or off, we can display characters or images on the screen.  Though the HD44780 based LCD that is included is a 5v display, we are only going to write to the pins so we can avoid needing a whole bunch of voltage dividers.
