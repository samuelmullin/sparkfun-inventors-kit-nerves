# Circuit 5b - Drive

## Overview

In [Circuit 5b](./base), you'll control two simple motors using the Raspberry Pi and the TB6612FNG motor driver and use them to drive a simple robot forward.

## Challenges

There are no challenge implementations for this circuit as they don't diverge from the base logic enough to warrant including.

## Hardware

In order to complete these circuits, you'll need the following:

- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x TB6612FNG Motor Driver
- 1 x DG01D Motor (+ Wheel)
- 1 x External Battery Pack
- 1 x SPST switch
- 9 x M-F Jumper cables
- 5 x M-M Jumper cables
