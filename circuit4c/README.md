# Circuit 4C - DIY Who Am I Game

## Overview

In [Circuit 4C](./base), You'll create a game where a word is displayed on an LCD screen and the player has to guess the word from hints given by other players.  Once they guess the word, they press a button and a new word is displayed.  If they guess all the words before the timer runs out, they win!

Note that while the example in the book powers the Arduino using the battery pack, we have the Pi plugged in.  Powering the pi would require an extra module, such as a Li-ion battery hat, that I don't have on hand.

## Challenges

There are no challenge implementations for this circuit as they don't diverge from the base logic enough to warrant including.

## Hardware

In order to complete these circuits, you'll need the following:

- 1 x Breadboard
