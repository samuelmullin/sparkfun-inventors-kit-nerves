# Circuit 2A- Buzzer

## Overview

In [Circuit 2a](./base), you'll play songs via a Piezo buzzer and control it's volume using a potentiometer.  If you need to hear the song over and over again, the included button will allow it.

## Challenges

There are no challenge implementations for this circuit as they don't diverge from the base logic enough to warrant including.

## Hardware

In order to complete these circuits, you'll need the following:

- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x Piezo Buzzer
- 1 x Analog Potentiometer
- 3 x M-F Jumper Cables
- 2 x M-M Jumper Cables

## New Concepts

### Piezo Buzzer

[Piezo Buzzer](Wow a link) converts electical pulses to sound (and vice versa, though we don't get into that).  By sending pulses of electricty at different frequencies, it can play notes.
