# Circuit 3C - Proximity Alarm

## Overview

In [Circuit 3C](./base), you'll build a proximity alarm by combining an ultrasonic distance sensor, a servo, an RGB LED and a Buzzer.

## Challenges

There are no challenge implementations for this circuit as they don't diverge from the base logic enough to warrant including.

## Hardware

In order to complete these circuits, you'll need the following:

- 1 x Breadboard
- 1 x RGB LED
- 3 x 330ohm Resistor
- 7 x M-F Jumper cables
- 6 x M-M Jumper cables
- 1 x Analog Photoresistor
- 1 x Micro Servo
